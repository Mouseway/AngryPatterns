# AngryPatterns

I created this project as a semestral work in NI-ADP class.
The class focused on teaching students programming patterns and software architecture.
That's a reason why the project is unnecessarily full of them.
The app has MVC architecture.

- Abstract Factory
- Bridge
- Command
- Memento
- Observer

## How to play

- Move down - Arrow down
- Shoot - Space
- Aim up - A
- Aim down - Y
- Power up - F
- Power down - D
- Shooting strategy - M
- Shooting mode - N
- Undo - Z
