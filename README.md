# AngryPatterns

I created this project as a semestral work in NI-ADP class.
The class focused on teaching students programming patterns and software architecture.
That's a reason why the project is unnecessarily full of them.
The app has MVC architecture.

## Used patterns
- Abstract Factory
- Bridge
- Command
- Memento
- Observer
- Proxy
- State
- Strategy
- Visitor
